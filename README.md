## ✨ **Features**

- **✅ Fully Autonomous Operation**: Launch with a single command. AI handles everything from 2FA/TOTP logins to final report
- **✅ Pentester-Grade Reports**: Reproducible exploits with concrete proof of vulnerabilities
- **✅ VS Code Integration**: Built-in support for seamless development workflow
- **✅ Whitebox Analysis**: Deep code inspection for comprehensive security coverage

## 🔥 **Why This Fork?**

This enhanced version adds **VS Code integration** for developers who want to:

- Run pentests directly from their editor
- View results in a dedicated sidebar
- Integrate with existing CI/CD workflows
- Get real-time vulnerability feedback during development

## 🎯 **What Problem Does Shannon Solve?**

Your team ships code non-stop with tools like Claude Code and Cursor, but penetration testing happens once a year. That's 364 days of potential vulnerabilities shipping to production.

Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester that **executes real exploits**, not just finds potential issues.

## 📊 **Performance**

Shannon achieves a **96.15% success rate** on a hint-free, source-aware XBOW benchmark.
